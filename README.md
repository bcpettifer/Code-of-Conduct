*This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in
the future.*

## Code of Conduct

### The **Inane Chat Slack** should be a safe place for everybody regardless of

- gender, gender identity or gender expression
- sexual orientation
- disability
- physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
- race
- age
- religion

### As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically
  or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist,
  etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
* We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humour.

### We actively work towards:

* Being a safe community
* Cultivating a network of support & encouragement for each other
* Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression

### We condemn:

* Stalking, doxxing, or publishing private information
* Threats of harm, harassment
* Anything that compromises people’s safety
* Personal attacks

**These things are NOT OK.**

### If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* Listen without interruption.
* Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they
  have to say.
* Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offence in the future.
* Apologise and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries
consequences. For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from the
Slack. Upon repeat offences, or if the community believes you are not acting in
good faith, you may be asked to leave permanently.

### Privacy

* All conversations are private unless otherwise specified.
* If you wish to share a conversation, or part of one, you must get permission
  from each person involved.

### Good conduct

The goal of the Inane Chat slack is to provide a shared space for Deliveroo
alumni — past and present — to talk, share their experiences and generally keep
in touch. However, with this come some limitations and general guidelines as to
what constitutes good conduct:

* The Inane Chat slack is _not_ a place to publicly air your grievances with, or
  complain about the company.
* No Confidential information related to the company should ever be posted on
  this Slack.*
* Job adverts should be posted in #jobs only. Do not reach out to individuals for
  hiring purposes.

In general, treat the Slack as an extension of the official company Slack for
employees; consider anything you write publicly as having the potential to be
seen by any current member of Deliveroo staff, from anyone in HR all the way up
to the executive level.

**If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, let a
moderator know. Here is a list of the current admins and their Slack IDs:**

* Ben Darlow - `@kapowaz`
* Maria Neumayer - `@maria`
* Ben Pettifer - `@Ben`
* Amal Kakaiya - `@amal`
* Padraic Ward - `@pauric`

*The role of the admins is to be an unbiased mediator, they will not moderate or
edit anything written in the Slack unless it is required as a result of a
discussed dispute.*

*Since the Inane Chat slack has become a conversational hub for employees
affected by the Spring 2020 series of redundancies, one exception to this point
is that confidential information related to these redundancies can be discussed,
exclusively on private channels with other affected employees. Please be mindful
of the need for discretion, and careful about what information you share.

If you are an employee affected by redundancies, please message a mod to be
invited to any relevant private channels.

## Member Invites

The Inane Chat Slack has sign-ups enabled for anybody with a Deliveroo email
address. If you’d like to invite a former employee, contact an admin and they
can arrange to send an invitation.

Because this Slack group is intended to be a positive, friendly community,
admins reserve the right to deny admission or revoke membership based on CoC
violating behavior outside of the Slack chat environment (e.g. in person,
GitHub, social media), if necessary.  If there is any person you would like to
keep _out_ of the Slack for any reason related to the above, message one of the
admins.

## Slack Etiquette

### Slack Commands

Many members of Inane Chat have this Slack open during the work day, or
installed on their phones. Additionally, there are members in many different
time zones. Please be cautious about using  `@channel` or `@everyone` and avoid
it if possible.
